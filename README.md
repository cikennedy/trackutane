## Description

A mobile application that can help healthcare professionals track and accurately chart a patient's Accutane history and dosage. This will calculate a patient's history with the medicine, what dose they will continue with, and when they will reach their cumulative goal dose. This application will save dermatology professionals time and headache while the patients will receive the proper treatment that they require.
